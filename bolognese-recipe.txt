Ingredients:

2 cloves of garlic
1 onion
2 sprigs of fresh rosemary
6 rashers dry-cured higher-welfare smoked streaky bacon
olive oil
500 g minced beef
200 ml red wine
1 x 280 g jar of sun-dried tomatoes
2 x 400 g tins of plum tomatoes
500 g dried spaghetti
Parmesan cheese
extra virgin olive oil

Method:

1- Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4.
2- Peel and finely chop the garlic and onions, pick and finely chop the rosemary, then finely slice the bacon.
3- Heat a splash of oil in a casserole pan on a medium heat, add the bacon, rosemary, garlic and onion and cook for 5 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally.
4- Add the minced beef, breaking it apart with the back of a spoon, then cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until starting to brown, then pour in the wine. Leave to bubble and cook away.
5- Meanwhile, drain and tip the sun-dried tomatoes into a food processor, blitz to a paste, then add to the pan with the tomatoes. Stir well, break the plum tomatoes apart a little.
6- Cover with a lid then place in the oven for 1 hour, removing the lid and giving it a stir after 30 minutes – if it looks a little dry at this stage, add a splash of water to help it along.
7- About 10 minutes before the time is up, cook the spaghetti in boiling salted water according to the packet instructions.
8- Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain, reserving a mugful of cooking water, then return to the pan with a few spoons of Bolognese, a good grating of Parmesan and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.
9- Toss to coat the spaghetti, loosening with a splash of cooking water, if needed.
10- Divide the spaghetti between plates or bowls, add a good spoonful of Bolognese to each, then serve with a fine grating of Parmesan.
